# Multiple Linear Regression Project

This project demonstrates how to apply **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict a target variable based on multiple independent features using **Python** and **Scikit-Learn**.

---

##  Project Overview

This notebook walks through:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection and removal
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- Building and training a Multiple Linear Regression model
- Model evaluation using MAE, MSE, RMSE, and RÂ² metrics
- Visualization of relationships and predictions

##  Concepts Covered

- Linear regression fundamentals  
- Correlation and multicollinearity  
- Feature importance  
- Model performance metrics  
- Outlier handling using the IQR method
